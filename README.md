Simple [mustache template](https://mustache.github.io/) based resume generation. Easy to customize html template and/or css and tex template to your own style.

Make sure [mustache cli](https://github.com/quantumew/mustache-cli) and a TeX distribution of some kind with xelatex (tested with TeX Live) are installed.

Simply run `generate_resumes.sh < path/to/resume.json` and files will be generated in `output` directory.
